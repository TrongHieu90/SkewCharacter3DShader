# SkewCharacter3DShader
Simple Unity shader to skew / tilt shader of 3d character to match perspective of 2d background / 2d sprites. It makes the 3d character shows more face, more personality.

**Some known issues:**
Any item put into main character(eg: weapon) will have their view distorted. One way to fix this is to make the weapon a part of main character's skeleton rig.
